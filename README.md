# socketprogramming
This is simple SSL socket programming using java with a certeficate
As you may know there are two type of cryptography known as Asymmetric and symmetric, and when with the Internet connection we use the ssl/tls protocol which help us to connect server with client with public encrypted system so even if it may intercept the data at the middle , the data could be meaningless. so I try to implement this concept with single computer based server and client connection with java . If you have any question you can ask me --keba.
